🔐 AUTHENTICATION FIX APPLIED - RE-LOGIN REQUIRED!

The authentication token system has been fixed. All users must re-login to get new tokens.

STEPS TO FIX YOUR SESSION:

1. LOGOUT (clear old token)
2. LOGIN AGAIN (get new token)
3. TEST ORDER PLACEMENT

CUSTOMER LOGIN:
http://localhost:5000/pages/customer/login.html
Email: test@example.com
Password: password123

RESTAURANT LOGIN:
http://localhost:5000/pages/restaurant/login.html
(Use your restaurant credentials)

ADMIN LOGIN:
http://localhost:5000/pages/admin/login.html
Email: admin@tastenow.com
Password: admin123

WHAT WAS FIXED:
- JWT token now includes correct userRole
- Middleware now reads userRole correctly
- Order placement will work after re-login
- Restaurant dashboard will work after re-login

CHECK SERVER LOGS:
After re-login, you should see:
✅ Token verified - userId: X role: customer (or restaurant/admin)

NOT:
❌ Token verified - userId: X role: undefined

Once you re-login, try placing an order. It should work!
